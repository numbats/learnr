### Why should you use R projects?

* Allows quick switching between projects within the RStudio IDE.

* Opening a project restores your open tabs from last use.

* Enables features specific to that project type, such as testing packages or building a website.

* Encourages organised file structure practices, notably a project should contain all files used by that project.

![project selector](chapter4/project_1.png)

Note: Create a new project by clicking the project selector in the top right corner. This will show you your most recent R projects, and is great for quickly switching between them. To create a new project, select "New Project...".

---

![new project](chapter4/project_2.png)

Note: 
If you want to start a new R project in a new location on your computer, select 'New Directory'. 

If you want to start a new R project in a location where you have other R projects, select 'Existing Directory'.

For you very first R project, please select 'New Directory'.  

---

![project directories](chapter4/project_3.png)

Note: There are many different types of R projects that you can create. For a data analysis project we would typically start from an empty 'New Project'. Have a scroll through to see all of the different project types you can create. If you've installed some packages like I have, you'll see some package specific project types too.

For an empty R project, click 'New Project'.  

---

![project types](chapter4/project_4.png)

Note: Give your project (and the folder that will contain it) a name using the 'Directory name' field.
You can also choose where the project will exist on your computer by clicking the 'Browse...' button.

The checkboxes can be left unticked, if you want these features you can add them later.

Click 'Create Project' to create the project.

---

![project name](chapter4/project_5.png)

Note: There you have it! You're brand new R project.
You can see just below the 'Console' tab selector that we are now in the '~/my-awesome-project/' folder. This is exactly where we created our project, and all scripts and data should also be stored here (more on that later).

You can also see that the project selector in the top right now indicates that we are in the 'my-awesome-project' project.

---

### Keeping projects self contained

Projects should be self contained, meaning that all files and data exist within the project. 

This is useful for if you're sharing your project with others, as you can directly share the project folder and all of its contents.

---

### Storing some data in the project

Let's create a dataset in our project. To do this I first create a 'data' folder using a 'New Folder' from the Files tab.

Then, I save the `mtcars` dataset in that folder using by running this code in the 'Console'.

```
readr::write_csv(mtcars, "data/mtcars.csv")
```

---

---

### Relative paths

Note that the file path used to save the dataset (`"data/mtcars.csv"`) is a relative path.

As we are in the 'my-awesome-project', any file paths we use are 'relative' to that project folder.

That is to say `"data"` refers to the project's "data" folder, and `"data/mtcars.csv"` is the "mtcars.csv" file in the "data" folder.

Relative paths are great, as it allows anyone who has your project to run the code without changing file paths.

---

### Absolute paths

An absolute path describes exactly where on your computer the file should be saved.

Absolute paths should never be used in projects, as others will not be able to run the code you provide.

This is because absolute paths to a project vary with operating systems, and where the project is stored.

---

### Absolute paths on different computers

The absolute path to the dataset on my computer (macOS/Linux) is
```
/home/learnr/my-awesome-project/data/mtcars.csv
```

The equivalent location on someone else's Windows computer is
```
C:\Users\learnr\Documents\my-awesome-project\data\mtcars.csv
```

The **relative path** to the dataset on all computers is 
```
data/mtcars.csv
```
Much better!

### Don't save your workspace image

When closing RStudio you might be greeted with this popup:

![save workspace](chapter4/save_workspace.png)

You should select `Don't Save`!

---

### Don't save your workspace image

Saving the workspace stores all of the objects you've created for next time you open the project.

Sounds great, but it's bad for reproducibility. All objects in the environment should be produced with code, and that code should be saved in the project.

This helps to ensure that others are able to run your code and produce the results you have.

---

### Don't save your workspace image

You can also prevent saving workspaces in the 'Global Options':
