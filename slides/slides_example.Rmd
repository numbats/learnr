```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center",
                      fig.width = 4, 
                      fig.height = 4)
```

## Example slides

Here are some slides. You can use these to demonstrate the concept before 
testing their understanding with tasks. 

Focus on content, not style when writing the slides to achieve a uniform design.

To separate content onto the next slide, use `---` on a new line.

---

In slides you can provide R code examples;

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
mtcars %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(cyl), y = mpg)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

---

Math works too:

$$\dfrac{\beta}{\alpha}$$


You can also write math inline: $\beta/\alpha$
