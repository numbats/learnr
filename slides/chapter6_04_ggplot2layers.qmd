title: Multiple layers in `ggplot2`

```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(#fig.path = "images/chapter6-04/",
                      fig.align = "center",
                      fig.width = 4, 
                      fig.height = 4,
                      echo = TRUE)
library(ggplot2)
```


## Layer


* A layer is comprised of:
   - `data` 
   - `mapping` 
   - statistical transformation (`stat`)
   - geometric object (`geom`)
   - position adjustment (`position`)
* `data` and `mapping` are often inherited from `ggplot`

Notes: 

* A layer is usually added using functions with prefix `geom_` and `stat_`
* Technically, there are more components but we won't go into those. 

---

## The violin plot layer

```{r plot1-cut}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_violin()
```


Notes: 

* There is one layer in this plot comprising of:
  * inherited `data`: `diamonds`
  * inherited `mapping`: `aes(x = cut, y = price)`
  * `geom`: violin
  * `stat`: density for the y-axis (`ydensity`)
  * `position`: dodge
  
* You don't see `position = "dodge"` much in action here because there is only one group for each level of x.

---

## You can add more than one layer

```{r plot1-layer2}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_violin() + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1)
```

Notes: 

* We now have the boxplot layer on top of the violin plot layer.

---

## The order of the layer matters

```{r plot1-layer-order}
ggplot(data = diamonds,
       mapping = aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +
  geom_violin()
```

Notes:

* You can't see the boxplot here because it's been hidden by the violin plot.

---

## Inheriting data and mapping

* A layer inherits the data and mapping from the initialised ggplot object by default

## Layer-specific data and aesthetic mapping

![](images/ggplot-multiple-layers-data-mapping.png)

* For each layer, aesthetic and/or data can be overwritten

---

## Overwriting data and aesthetic

```{r plot2-inheritance, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 3, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr) # needed for data wrangling
ggplot(data = diamonds, aes(x = cut, y = price)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = cut)) + 
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1) +
  geom_text(data = function(data) data %>% 
              group_by(cut) %>% 
              tally(),
            aes(y = 0, label = n), nudge_y = -0.2)
```

Notes: 

* You can see that `fill` is only applied the violin plot. 
* For text layer shows the the total number of observations on the bottom of the violin plot. This display requires a summarised data of the inherited data. 
* The input `data` for each subsequent layer can be a `data.frame` or a function. If it's a function it's applied to the data that it inherited -- it's handy for cases like this where you want to use the summarised or processed form of the inherited data!

## Aesthetic or Attribute?


_Not_ what you want:

```{r aes-map}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = "dodgerblue"))
```

Notes: 

* When you supply values within `aes`, it assumes that it's a data variable. 
* The string `"dodgerblue"` gets converted into a variable with one level and it gets colored by `ggplot`'s default color palette.

---

## When your input is an attribute


Don't put attributes inside `aes()`!

```{r attr-map}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(color = "dodgerblue")
```


---

## Bonus tip

* Use `I()` operator to mean "as-is" in aesthetic mapping.

```{r I-map}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = I("dodgerblue")))
```

---

## Attributes are for layers


* Attributes should be defined in specific layers.

```{r attr-in-ggplot}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(carat, price),
       color = "dodgerblue") +
  geom_point()
```

Notes:

* Notice how the points don't have the "dodgeblue" color.
* Layers inherit data and the mapping from `ggplot()` but not attributes like this. 

---

## Annotation layer


* `annotate()` allows you to add elements to plots without a `data.frame`

```{r annotate, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3}
ggplot(diamonds, aes(color, fill = cut)) +
  geom_bar(color = "black") + 
  annotate("text", x = "I", y = 9000, 
           label = paste(nrow(diamonds), "diamonds"))
```

Notes: 

* `annotate()` is useful if you want to add small annotations to plot and it's too cumbersome for you to put the data as a `data.frame`

---

## Summary


* We've seen how you can add multiple layers in `ggplot`.
* You can define layer-specific data or mappings. 
* An attribute of a graphical parameter must be placed outside of `aes()` in the corresponding layer. 
* You can add the annotation layer using `annotate()`.
