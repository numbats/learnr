## Why data visualisation?

<blockquote>
A picture is worth a thousand words
</blockquote>

* Data visualisation is a powerful tool to **_explore_**, **_understand_** and **_communicate_** data

## Graphics

* Graphics are commonly stored in a standard image format such as svg, jpg, png, pdf, and so on. 
* When you view these graphics electronically, you would be using some graphical device to render the stored image 
* R would render these using either `windows`, `X11` or `quartz` graphical devices (depending on the your operating system)
* This rendering is carried out by R's graphics engine, `grDevices`, which is one of the core package within the R system
