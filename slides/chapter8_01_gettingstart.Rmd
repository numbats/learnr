### Installing packages 

- `install.pacakges("rmarkdown)`: need to install this package to use R Markdown

- `install.packages("tinytex")`: install `tinytex` package for pdf output. After installing `tinytex`, run `tinytex::install_tinytex()` to install `TinyTeX`. 


Note: Once you finish installing packages, you are ready to start your journey with R Markdown.

### Start your very first R Markdown 

You should see `R Markdown` when you click on `r icons::fontawesome("plus", style = "solid")`. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/adding_rmd.png")
```

---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/naming.png")
```

Note: Once you clicked on `R Markdown`, you should see this pop-up window. You can put in the title for your R Markdown and state the author. You can also change this later. There are three default formate for R Markdown including html,pdf and word. You can also change the output file later. 


---

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/rmd-demo.png")
```


Note: Once you clicked on `OK`, it will automatically generate an Rmd (R Markdown) file with example. You can read through this demonstration with examples. You can click on `Knit` (the blue ball of yarn) and it will generate an html output file.

### R Markdown Basics 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/demo-first-rmd.png")
```

---

### Knitting: from `.Rmd` to `.html`

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/demo-knit-html.png")
```

---

### Knitting: from `.Rmd` to `.pdf`

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/chapter9/demo-knit-pdf.png")
```

---

### Behind the screen 

`Knitr` covers `.Rmd` to `.md`. `rmarkdown` prepare the `.md` file and use [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) to convert `.md` to our destination file output such as `.pdf` and `.html`.
