Learning how to read and use them allows you to\n(i) understand complex operations and (ii) express operations that you\nwant to perform in a compact and elegant way.\n\nA **vector** is an ordered finite list of numbers.\n\nIn R, vectors are one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data,\ncharacter data or logical data. You can create a vector in R with the\ncombine function `c()`, where each element in the vector is separated by\na comma `,`.\n\n---\n\n## Vector Operations\n\n**Vector addition and subtraction**\n\nIf `a` and `b` are vectors of the same size, `a+b` and `a-b` give their\nsum and difference, respectively.\n\n    a <- c(1,2,3)\n    b <- c(100,200,300)\n    a+b\n\n    ## [1] 101 202 303\n\n    a-b\n\n    ## [1]  -99 -198 -297\n\n---\n\n**Scalar-vector multiplication and division**\n\nIf `c` is a number and `a` is a vector (from above), you can express the\nscalar-vector product either as `c*a` or `a*c`. For example, if you do\n`3*a` and `a*3`:\n\n    3*a\n\n    ## [1] 3 6 9\n\n    a*3\n\n    ## [1] 3 6 9\n\n---\n\n**Scalar-vector addition**\n\nIn R, you can add a scalar `c` and a vector `a` using c+a. This means\nthat the scalar is added to each element of the vector.\n\nFor example, if you do `3+a`:\n\n    3+a\n\n    ## [1] 4 5 6\n\nThis is, however, **NOT** a standard mathematical notation.\n\n(In mathematical notations, we should use this as, e.g. *a* + *c***1**,\nwhere *a* is a vector and *c* is a scalar.)\n\n---\n\n## Indexing and Slicing\n\n**Indexing**\n\nA specific element *x*<sub>*i*</sub> is selected with the expression\n`x[i]` where `i` is the index.\n\nSay, we would like to obtain the 5th entry from the following vector\n*x*:\n\n    x = c(5,6,3,4,5,8,23,4,6,4,3,23,7,5,4,23,7,90)\n    x[5]\n\n    ## [1] 5\n\nNotes:\n\nTo select elements of a vector (and later matrices, data frames, …), you\ncan use square brackets (`[ ]`). Between the square brackets, you\nindicate what elements to select. For example, consider a vector *x*, a\nspecific element *x*<sub>*i*</sub> is selected with the expression\n`x[i]` where `i` is the index (which runs from 1 to *n*, for a vector\nwith *n* elements).\n\n---\n\n**Slicing**\n\n*x*<sub>*r* : *s*</sub> denotes the slice of the vector from index *r*\nto *s*.\n\nFor instance, `x[1:4]` selects the element from index 1 to 4.\n\n    x[1:4]\n\n    ## [1] 5 6 3 4\n\nNotes:\n\nSometimes it is of interest to extract a slice of a vector (a\nsub-vector) using an index range as the argument.\n*x*<sub>*r* : *s*</sub> denotes the slice of the vector from index *r*\nto *s*.\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter2_03_vectors"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## Matrices\n\nA **matrix** is a rectangular array of numbers written between\nrectangular brackets (or large parentheses).\n\nFor example, matrix `A` is defined as follow:\n\n$$ A = \\\\begin{bmatrix}4&3&2\\\\\\\\7&4&2\\\\\\\\6&3&4\\\\\\\\3&0&0\\\\\\\\2&-2&-3 \\\\end{bmatrix} $$\nNote:\n\nMatrix `A` here is a 5 × 3 matrix (pronounced as `5 by 3`, indicating\nthere are 5 rows and 3 columns in the matrix).\n\n---\n\nYou can construct a matrix in R using the `matrix()` function.\n\nYou can express the matrix `A` on the previous slide with the following\nR code:\n\n    A <- matrix(c(4,3,2,7,4,2,6,3,4,3,0,0,2,-2,-3), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n\nNote:\n\nIn R, a matrix is a collection of elements of the same data type\n(numeric, character, or logical) arranged into a fixed number of rows\nand columns.\n\nIn the R code shown on the slides:\n\n-   Here the first argument is the collection of elements that R will\n    arrange into the rows and columns of the matrix.\n\n-   The second argument `byrow` indicates the arrangement of elements is\n    done by filling the matrix by the rows. If you would like to fill\n    the matrix by columns, you can use `byrow=FALSE`.\n\n-   The third argument `nrow` indicates that the number of rows in the\n    matrix.\n\n---\n\n### Matrix Operations\n\nConsider the following operation:\n\n    A <- matrix(c(4,3,2,7,4,2,6,3,4,3,0,0,2,-2,-3), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n    2*A\n\n    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n    ## [1,]    8    6    4\n    ## [2,]   14    8    4\n    ## [3,]   12    6    8\n    ## [4,]    6    0    0\n    ## [5,]    4   -4   -6\n\n`2 * A` multiplies each element of `A` by two.\n\nNotes:\n\nSimilar to what you have learned with vectors, the standard operators\nlike `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, etc. work in an element-wise way on matrices in\nR.\n\nFor example, `2 * A` multiplies each element of `A` by two.\n\n---\n\nConsider another matrix `B` defined as\n\n    B <- matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n\n`A*B` creates a matrix where each element is the product of the\ncorresponding elements in matrix `A` and matrix `B`.\n\n    B <- matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n    A*B\n\n    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3]\n    ## [1,]    4    3    2\n    ## [2,]   14    8    4\n    ## [3,]    0    0    0\n    ## [4,]   -3    0    0\n    ## [5,]    0    0    0\n\nNote:\n\nThose who are familiar with matrices should note that `A*B` creates a\nmatrix where each element is the product of the corresponding elements\nin matrix `A` and matrix `B`. It is **not** the standard matrix\nmultiplication for which you should use `%*%` in R.\n\n---\n\n### Add rows or columns to a matrix\n\nSometimes we may want to add new data or information to a matrix with\nmore rows or more columns.\n\nYou can use the `cbind()` function.\n\n    A <- matrix(c(4,3,2,7,4,2,6,3,4,3,0,0,2,-2,-3), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n    B <- matrix(c(1,1,1,2,2,2,0,0,0,-1,-1,-1,0,0,0), byrow=TRUE, nrow=5)\n    big_matrix <- cbind(A, B)\n    big_matrix\n\n    ##      [,1] [,2] [,3] [,4] [,5] [,6]\n    ## [1,]    4    3    2    1    1    1\n    ## [2,]    7    4    2    2    2    2\n    ## [3,]    6    3    4    0    0    0\n    ## [4,]    3    0    0   -1   -1   -1\n    ## [5,]    2   -2   -3    0    0    0\n\nNote:\n\nYou can add a column or multiple columns to a matrix with the `cbind()`\nfunction, which merges matrices and/or vectors together by column. For\nexample, `cbind(A,B)` yields a bigger matrix by merging matrix A and B.\nThe resulting matrix has 5 rows and 6 columns.\n\n---\n\nSimilarly, you can add a row or multiple rows to a matrix with the\n`rbind()` function.\n\n    big_matrix2 <- rbind(A,B)\n    big_matrix2\n\n    ##       [,1] [,2] [,3]\n    ##  [1,]    4    3    2\n    ##  [2,]    7    4    2\n    ##  [3,]    6    3    4\n    ##  [4,]    3    0    0\n    ##  [5,]    2   -2   -3\n    ##  [6,]    1    1    1\n    ##  [7,]    2    2    2\n    ##  [8,]    0    0    0\n    ##  [9,]   -1   -1   -1\n    ## [10,]    0    0    0\n\nNote:\n\nFor example, `big_matrix2 <- rbind(A,B)` returns a bigger matrix by\nputting matrix A on top of matrix B. The resulting matrix has 10 rows\nand 3 columns.\n\n---\n\n### Indexing\n\nYou can use the square brackets (`[ ]`) and comma (`,`) to select one or\nmultiple elements from a matrix.\n\nFor example, `A[1:4,3:5]` returns a matrix with the data on the rows 1,\n2, 3, 4 and columns 3, 4, 5.\n\nIf you want to select all elements of a row or a column, you can do the\nfollowing:\n\n-   `A[,1]` selects all elements of the first column of matrix A.\n-   `A[1,]` selects all elements of the first row of matrix A.\n\nNotes:\n\nSimilar to vectors, you can use the square brackets `[ ]` to select one\nor multiple elements from a matrix. Whereas vectors have one dimension,\nmatrices have two dimensions. You should therefore use a comma to\nseparate the rows you want to select from the columns.\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter2_05_matrices"}}},{"node":{"rawMarkdownBody":"## Relational operators\n\nRelational operators, or comparators, are operators which help us see\nhow one R object relates to another. The relational operators in R are:\n\n-   `<` for less than\n-   `>` for greater than\n-   `<=` for less than or equal to\n-   `>=` for greater than or equal to\n-   `==` for equal to each other\n-   `!=` not equal to each other\n\n---\n\nYou can use these command on scalar.\n\nFor example,\n\n    8 > 1\n\n    ## [1] TRUE\n\n`8 > 1` return `TRUE` since 8 is larger than 1.\n\n    8 ==1\n\n    ## [1] FALSE\n\n`8 == 1` return `FALSE` since 8 is not equal to 1.\n\nNotes:\n\nRelational operators:\n\n-   `<` for less than\n-   `>` for greater than\n-   `<=` for less than or equal to\n-   `>=` for greater than or equal to\n-   `==` for equal to each other\n-   `!=` not equal to each other\n\n---\n\nThese command also extends to vectors.\n\nFor example,\n\n    c(0,5,100) == 5\n\n    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE FALSE\n\nBoth the first and the last entry evaluates to `FALSE` and only the\nsecond entry returns `TRUE` (equal to 5).\n\nNotes:\n\nRelational operators:\n\n-   `<` for less than\n-   `>` for greater than\n-   `<=` for less than or equal to\n-   `>=` for greater than or equal to\n-   `==` for equal to each other\n-   `!=` not equal to each other\n\nThese command also extends to vectors. It tests for every element of the\nvector if the condition stated by the comparison operator is TRUE or\nFALSE.\n\nYou can see that both the first and the last entry evaluates to `FALSE`\nand only the second entry returns `TRUE` since the second entry is equal\nto 5.\n\n---\n\nNow if instead we do\n\n    c(0,5,100) >= 5\n\n    ## [1] FALSE  TRUE  TRUE\n\nYou can see the output changed since 100 is also greater than or equal\nto 5.\n\nIf we change our code into\n\n    c(0,5,100) < 5\n\n    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\nYou can see the output changed where the second entry is also `FALSE`\nsince 5 is not strictly less than 5.\n\n---\n\nNote that R also support element-wise comparison if we put a relational\noperator between two vectors:\n\n    c(2,4,6) < c(3,5,7)\n\n    ## [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE\n\n---\n\n## Logical opeators\n\nNext, you can change or combine the results of relational comparisons\nusing:\n\n-   the AND (`&`) operator\n-   the OR (`|`) operator\n-   the NOT (`!`) operator\n\nNotes:\n\nNow you know how to use relational operators in R. Next, what if you\nwant to change or combine the results of these comparisons? In R, you\ncan do this using the AND (`&`), the OR (`|`), and the NOT (`!`)\noperator.\n\n---\n\n**the AND (`&`) operator**\n\nThe AND operator typically takes two logical values and returns TRUE\nonly if both the logical values are TRUE themselves.\n\nFor example, if we check the entries of the following vector x is\ngreater than 2 AND less than 6, we expect `TRUE` for the three entries\nin the middle.\n\n    x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n    (x>2)&(x<6)\n\n    ## [1] FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE FALSE FALSE\n\n---\n\n**the OR (`|`) operator**\n\nThe OR operator (|) works similarly, but the difference is that only at\nleast one of the logical values it uses should be equal to TRUE for the\nentire OR operation to evaluate to TRUE.\n\nFor example,\n\n    x = c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)\n    (x>4)|(x<2)\n\n    ## [1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE  TRUE  TRUE  TRUE\n\n---\n\n**the NOT (`!`) operator**\n\nThe NOT operator negates the logical value it’s used on.\n\nSay we want to check if an object `a` is a numeric, where `a` is\nactually a string `rain`, we expect the output to be `FALSE`.\n\n    a <- \"rain\"\n    is.numeric(a)\n\n    ## [1] FALSE\n\n    #if the input is actually a number\n    is.numeric(100)\n\n    ## [1] TRUE\n\nNotes:\n\nThe NOT operator negates the logical value it’s used on.\n\nFor example, the built-in R function, is `is.numeric()` checks if an R\nobject is a numeric.\n\nSay we want to check if an object `a` is a numeric, where `a` is\nactually a string `rain`, we expect the output to be `FALSE`.\n\nConsider also object `b` is a number, then the expected output is\n`TRUE`.\n\n---\n\nIf we, instead, use `!is.numeric(a)` to check if `a` is, the output is\nnow `TRUE`.\n\n    !is.numeric(a)\n\n    ## [1] TRUE\n\nAnd when we run `!is.numeric(100)` in R, the output would be `FALSE`.\n\n    !is.numeric(100)\n\n    ## [1] FALSE\n\n---\n\n## Conditional statements\n\nNow we are ready to learn about conditional statements:\n\n-   if\n-   else\n-   else if\n\nNotes:\n\nNow we are ready to learn about conditional statements: if, else, else\nif.\n\nThese conditional statements are very useful in data analysis since\noften we want to treat the data differently depending on certain\nconditions.\n\n---\n\n**if statement**\n\nThe syntax of an if statement looks like this:\n\n    if (condition) {\n      do_this\n    }\n\nSo if the `condition` is evaluated to be `TRUE`, the code included in\nthe curly bracket (`do_this`) will be executed.\n\n---\n\nFor example, `customer_rating` contains a rating (out of 5) from a\ncustomer dined in a restaurant.\n\nWe consider a customer to be happy if the rating is greater than or\nequal to 4.\n\n    customer_rating = 4\n    if (customer_rating >= 4){\n      print(\"Customer is happy!\")\n    }\n\n    ## [1] \"Customer is happy!\"\n\n---\n\n**else statement**\n\nYou can only use an else statement together with an if statement.\n\nThe syntax of an else statement looks like this:\n\n    if (condition) {\n      do_this\n    } else {\n      do_this_instead\n    }\n\nIt’s important that the syntax `else` is on the **same line** as the\nclosing bracket of the if part!\n\nNote:\n\nYou can only use an else statement together with an if statement.\n\nThe else statement does not require a condition.\n\nThe code that comes under the else statement is executed if all of the\nif statements evaluated to be `FALSE`.\n\nSo if the `condition` is evaluated to be `TRUE`, the code included in\nthe first curly bracket (`do_this`) will be executed. Otherwise, the\ncode included in the second curly bracket (`do_this_instead`) will be\nexecuted.\n\nIt’s important that the syntax `else` is on the **same line** as the\nclosing bracket of the if part!\n\n---\n\nFor example, we would like to be alerted if a customer is not happy.\n\n    customer_rating = 2\n    if (customer_rating >= 4){\n      print(\"Customer is happy!\")\n    } else { \n      print(\"Attention - unhappy customer!\")\n    }\n\n    ## [1] \"Attention - unhappy customer!\"\n\n---\n\n**else if statement**\n\nThe else if statement allows you to further customize your control\nstructure.\n\nThe syntax of an else if statement looks like this:\n\n    if (condition1) {\n      action1\n    } else if (condition2) {\n      action2\n    } else if (condition3) {\n      action3\n    } else {\n      action4\n    }\n\nNote:\n\nThe else if statement allows you to further customize your control\nstructure.

is `ggplot2`?\n\n-   `ggplot2` is an R-package that was initially developed by Hadley\n    Wickham as part of his PhD project.\n-   `ggplot2` implements an interpretation of the “The Grammar of\n    Graphics” by Leland Wilkinson.\n-   It is one of the most popular packages in R for data visualisation\n    and widely used in scientific outputs, reports, and even news\n    articles.\n\nNote:\n\n-   Currently `ggplot2` is maintained by Thomas Lin Pedersen along with\n    authors: Hadley Wickham, Winston Chang, Lionel Henry, Kohske\n    Takahashi, Claus Wilke, Kara Woo, Hiroaki Yutani and Dewey\n    Dunnington.\n-   `ggplot2` is an open-source tool so you can find all code for this\n    at <https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2>\n-   There are over 250 contributors to the package.\n-   Fun fact: Professor Dianne Cook at Monash University was the PhD\n    supervisor of Hadley Wickham when she was still at Iowa State\n    University.\n\n---\n\n## Installing and loading `ggplot2`\n\n-   To use `ggplot2`, you first have to install the package\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    install.packages(\"ggplot2\")\n\n-   Once you have installed it, you can load the package:\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    library(ggplot2)\n\n-   `ggplot2` is part of the `tidyverse` family so if you load\n    `tidyverse`, you don’t need to load `ggplot2` like above\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    library(tidyverse)\n\nNote:\n\n-   You can find more about `tidyverse` at <https://www.tidyverse.org/>\n-   If you use `library(tidyverse)`, it loads 8 packages:\n    -   `ggplot2`\n    -   `tibble`\n    -   `tidyr`\n    -   `readr`\n    -   `purrr`\n    -   `dplyr`\n    -   `stringr`\n    -   `forcats`\n\n---\n\n## Basic structure of `ggplot`\n\n![](images/ggplot-basic-str.png)\n\n1.  **data** as `data.frame`\n2.  a set of **aesthetic** mappings between variables in the data and\n    visual properties\n3.  at least one **layer** which describes how to render each\n    observation\n\nNote:\n\n-   The layer usually is function starting with `geom_` or `stat_`.\n\n---\n\n## Illustrative data 💰 Wages\n\n-   Let’s look at a survey of average hourly earnings in United States\n    where each observation is an individual.\n\n<!-- -->\n\n    data(CPSch3, package = \"Ecdat\")\n    str(CPSch3)\n\n    ## 'data.frame':    11130 obs. of  3 variables:\n    ##  $ year: int  1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 1992 ...\n    ##  $ ahe : num  13 11.6 17.4 10.1 16.8 ...\n    ##  $ sex : Factor w/ 2 levels \"male\",\"female\": 1 1 1 2 1 2 2 1 1 1 ...\n\nNote:\n\n-   Let’s use a data to illustrate the different layers in `ggplot2`.\n-   This data contains:\n    -   `year` = the survey year\n    -   `ahe` = the average hourly earnings\n    -   `sex` = the sex (male or female)\n\n---\n\n## Initialising the plot\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3) \n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/plot-initial-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n-   When there is no layer, it produces a blank layer (`geom_blank()`)\n    like the above plot.\n\nNote:\n\nThis graph isn’t really useful.\n\n---\n\n## Mapping data variables to aesthetics\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3,\n           mapping = aes(x = sex, y = ahe)) \n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/plot-mapping-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n-   This get the scale ready but no layer is defined so nothing is\n    rendered in the panel.\n\nNote:\n\nNotice that the scales are automatically setup based on the data – less\nwork for you to do in plotting the data.\n\n---\n\n## Layers\n\n-   Each layers have five main components:\n    -   `geom` - the geometric object to use display the data\n    -   `stat` - statistical transformation to use on the data\n    -   `data` - data to be displayed in this layer (usually inherited)\n    -   `mapping` - aesthetic mappings (usually inherited)\n    -   `position` - position adjustment\n\nNote:\n\n-   Most layer functions you use will start with `geom_`.\n\n---\n\n## Distribution of a single variable\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-1.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-2.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-3.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-4.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-5.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-single-6.png\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n-   Distribution of a single *continuous* variable can be studied with\n    **histogram**, **density or frequency plot**, **boxplot**, **violin\n    plot** or **dot plot**.\n-   If you have a discrete or categorical variable, you may like to\n    study this using a **barplot** (or sometimes called barchart).\n-   We’ll go through how to create these layers in `ggplot2` next.\n\n---\n\n## A histogram with `geom_histogram()`\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_histogram() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-histogram-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   By default `ggplot2` uses 30 bins (`bins = 30`) when drawing\n    histograms.\n-   It is often a good idea to try different number of bins (`bins`) or\n    different bin widths (`bindwidth`) to see how the **shape** of the\n    histogram changes.\n-   Here we can see that the distribution for the average hourly\n    earnings are slightly right skewed.\n-   The mode average hourly earning looks like it’s about US$14.\n-   To find more about how to change parameters of the layer, have a\n    look at the corresponding documentation (`?geom_histogram`).\n\n---\n\n## Layer data\n\n    g <- ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_histogram() \n

calculates other useful statistics as well (seen using\n    `layer_data`) and sometimes you want to use these instead.\n\n---\n\n## Layer data\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_histogram(aes(y = after_stat(density))) \n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-histogram-density-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   In this plot, the y-axis is showing density intead of count.\n-   This is signalled by using `y = after_stat(density)`.\n-   This syntax is equivalent to `y = stat(density)` or\n    `y = ..density..`, which was the old syntax to refer to computed\n    statistics.\n\n---\n\n## A density plot with `geom_density()`\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_density() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-density-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   A density plot is like a histogram where it reveals the distribution\n    of a (continuous) numerical variable.\n-   The y-axis is showing the density, which is esimated using a\n    particular kernel function.\n-   The estimated density can oversmooth or have problems in the tails –\n    so don’t only rely on density plots to tell you the full picture of\n    the data.\n\n---\n\n## A frequency polygon with `geom_freqpoly()`\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_freqpoly() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-freqpoly-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   The default `geom_freqpoly` is showing the same statistic\n    (`stat = \"bin\"`) as the default `geom_histogram` except one is using\n    a bar (`geom = \"bar\"`) and the other is using a line\n    (`geom = \"path\"`).\n\n---\n\n## A boxplot with `geom_boxplot()`\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_boxplot() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-boxplot-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   A boxplot depicts graphically the five number summary: minimum,\n    first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum.\n-   `geom_boxplot` is also useful in comparing distributions of multiple\n    numerical variables, like below, where each variable corresponds to\n    one boxplot.\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/boxplot-multiple-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n---\n\n## A violin plot with `geom_violin()`\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe, y = \"\")) +\n      geom_violin() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-violin-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   A dummy is required for `y` here!\n-   A violin plot depicts a density estimate of a continous variable.\n\n---\n\n## A dotplot with `geom_dotplot()`\n\n    ggplot(data = dplyr::sample_n(CPSch3, 200), \n           mapping = aes(x = ahe)) +\n      geom_dotplot() +\n      labs(x = \"Average hourly earnings (US$)\")\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-dotplot-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   A dotplot works best for small number of observations so this plot\n    is based on 200 random samples of the data.\n\n---\n\n## A barplot with `geom_bar()` with categorical variables\n\n    ggplot(data = CPSch3, \n           mapping = aes(x = sex)) +\n      geom_bar()\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-bar-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\nNote:\n\n-   If you have a categorical variable, then you usually want to study\n    the frequency of its categories.\n-   Notice here that the `stat = \"count\"` is computing the frequencies\n    for each category for you.\n\n---\n\n## A barplot with `geom_bar()` with discrete variables\n\n    ggplot(data = filter(CPSch3, year!=1994), \n           mapping = aes(x = year)) +\n      geom_bar()\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-bar2A-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin:

it’s easier to see the distance between bars are determined by the\n    numerical value.\n-   If you want to study each level in a discrete variable, then you may\n    want to convert the discrete variable to a factor instead\n    `x = factor(year)`.\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/geom-bar2B-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n-   When the variable is a factor or character,

your input data may already contain pre-computed counts.\n-   In this case, you don’t need `stat = \"count\"` to do the counting for\n    you.\n-   You can use `geom_col()` instead.\n-   This is essential a short hand for `geom_bar(stat = \"identity\")`\n    where `stat = \"identity\"` means that you will take the value as\n    supplied without any statistical tranformation.\n\n---\n\n## Modifying the layer parameters\n\n-   Layers often have default parameter values.\n-   E.g. in the frequency polygon, the default is to have `bins = 30`.\n-   It’s important to modify the parameters values appropriately\n-   More **details about the parameters of a layer is in the\n    documentation** of the corresponding function, e.g. `?geom_freqpoly`\n    to see the help file on the histogram layer.\n\n---\n\n## Examining two or more variables\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-two-1.png\"/><img src=\"images/chapter7-02/catalogue-two-2.png\"/><img

src=\"images/chapter7-01/datavis-catalogue-14.png\"/><img  src=\"images/chapter7-01/datavis-catalogue-15.png\"/>\n\nNote:\n\n-   There are a large range of choices to visualise your data.\n-   The data visualisation catalogue shown here is not exhaustive.\n-   A good data visualisation depends on a number of factors, including\n    the context of the data.\n-   We’ll give you some tips along the way but you shouldn’t take them\n    to be prescriptive.\n-   The most important thing is to **plot many graphs for your data** –\n    you never know what you will uncover by looking at different views\n    of your data!\n\n---\n\n## Graphics 🖼️\n\n-   Graphics are commonly stored in a standard image format such as\n    **svg**, **jpg** (or **jpeg**), **png**, **pdf**, and so on.\n-   When you view these graphics electronically, you would be using some\n    graphical device to render the stored image.\n-   In R, the graphic is rendered by the graphical engine, `grDevices`\n    (one of the core R package).\n\nNote:\n\n-   A core R package means that the package is already pre-installed in\n    a standard installation of R.\n-   This means that you do not need to install `grDevices` if you\n    already installed R.\n\n---\n\n## Graphics model in R\n\n-   Two main graphics model in R are implemented via two core packages:\n    -   `graphics` package, and\n    -   `grid` package.\n-   Plot using the `graphics` system is normally referred to as the\n    **base graphics**.\n-   If the graphics is produced using the `grid` package, then it is\n    using the **`grid` graphics** model.\n\nNote:\n\n-   Remember core package means that the packages are already\n    pre-installed in R – you do not need to install `graphics` and\n    `grid` packages.\n-   The `graphics` package is loaded when you launch R so there is no\n    need to load this.\n-   The `grid` package is *not* automatically loaded so you need to use\n    `library(grid)` to load the functions within it.\n-   You won’t use the `grid` package directly in a typical data\n    visualisation.\n\n---\n\n## Base graphics\n\n-   Base graphics are drawn via the `graphics` package.\n\n<img src=\"images/base-graphics.png\" width=\"50%\">\n\nNote:\n\n-   Functions like `plot()`, `barplot()`, `hist()` usually produce base\n    graphics.\n-   Base graphics draw a **complete plot** straight to the canvas\n    (i.e. the graphical device).\n-   There are some low-level base graphics functions like `legend()` and\n    `abline()` that draws a small segment of the plot but these are\n    drawn on top of an existing complete plot.\n-   We’ll only briefly cover base plots – most of the plots are expected\n    to be drawn using `ggplot2`.\n\n---\n\n## `grid` graphics\n\n-   The `grid` package contains low-level functions, i.e. draws only\n    parts of the plot.\n-   This system gives a lot of control over the graphics, but requires\n    the user to do a lot of work to draw a complete plot.\n-   You won’t be directly interacting with the `grid` package.\n-   Instead you’ll be using the **`ggplot2` package** that provides\n    high-level functions for plotting via the `grid` system.\n\nNote:\n\n-   Below is a demo of the `grid` package.\n-   It’s not designed to easily draw a complete plot.\n\n`library(grid)`\n\n`grid.circle()`\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-01/unnamed-chunk-3-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n`grid.newpage()`\n\n`grid.rect()`\n\n<img src=\"images/chapter7-01/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\" />\n\n---\n\n## Other graphical systems\n\n-   All other graphical systems are provided via contributed packages\n    (i.e. you need to install it once to use it).\n-   The two most well known packages are:\n    -   `lattice` and\n    -   `ggplot2`.\n-   Both of these packages use the `grid` package to draw the plots.\n\nNote:\n\n-   You’ll probably come across more graphical systems in your journey\n    in learning R!\n-   R also offers a range of interactive graphics, e.g. `plotly`, and\n    animated graphs, e.g. `gganimate`. We won’t be delving in these\n    though!\n\n---\n\n## Summary of R graphics\n\n![](images/r-graphics-system.png) Note:\n\n-   There are two main graphics model in R: base and grid graphics.\n-   All graphics are rendered using `grDevices` to your graphical\n    devices.\n-   `ggplot2` is a convenient framework to draw complete plots using the\n    `grid` graphics system.\n-   `ggplot2` is one of the most popular packages in R for data\n    visualisation and widely used in scientific outputs, reports, and\n    even news articles.\n-   In the following lessons we’ll focus only on learning to plot with\n    the `ggplot2` package.\n","fields":{"slug":"/chapter7_01_rgraphics"}}}]}}}
