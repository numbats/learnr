Which of the following is a contributed R package?

<choice>

<opt text="ggplot2" correct="true">

That's correct! ggplot2 was developed by Hadley Wickham as part of his PhD.

</opt>

<opt text="grid" >

No, this is a core package so it's already installed.

</opt>

<opt text="graphics" >

No, this a core package and loads automatically when you launch R.

</opt>

<opt text="grDevices" >

No, this a core package and loads automatically when you launch R.

Which R package actually renders the graphics in R?

<choice>

<opt text="ggplot2" >

No, that's incorrect.

</opt>

<opt text="grid" >

No, that's incorrect.

</opt>

<opt text="graphics" >

No, that's incorrect.

</opt>

<opt text="grDevices" correct="true">

Yes, that's right!

</opt>

</choice>

Remember that there are two primary graphic models in R: the base and grid graphics. Which one is `ggplot2` using?

<choice>

<opt text="base" >

No, that's incorrect.

</opt>

<opt text="grid" correct="true">

Yes that's right! Well done!

<exercise id="4" title="Make basic plots with `ggplot2`">

For the following questions we are going to use `BudgetFood` data from the `Ecdat` package which contains the budget share of food for Spanish households. You can load the dataset and see the structure of the data below.


```r
library(Ecdat)
```

```
## Error in library(Ecdat): there is no package called 'Ecdat'
```

```r
str(BudgetFood)
```

```
## Error in str(BudgetFood): object 'BudgetFood' not found
```
The meaning of the variables are described below:

* `wfood`: percentage of total expenditure which the household has spent on food
* `totexp`: total expenditure of the household
* `age`: age of reference person in the household
* `size`: size of the household
* `town`: size of the town where the household is placed categorized into 5 groups: 1 for small towns, 5 for big ones
* `sex`: sex of reference person (man,woman)

Try to recreate the scatter plot below. Is there anything that unusual that you notice about the plot?

```

We are again going to use the `BudgetFood` data from the `Ecdat` package to make the plots.
