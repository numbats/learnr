Which of the following is a contributed R package?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(mc_opts("ggplot2" = "That's correct! ggplot2 was developed by Hadley Wickham as part of his PhD.",
         "grid" = "No, this is a core package so it's already installed.",
         "graphics" = "No, this a core package and loads automatically when you launch R.",
         "grDevices" = "No, this a core package and loads automatically when you launch R.",
         correct = 1))
```

Which R package actually renders the graphics in R?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(mc_opts("ggplot2" = "No, that's incorrect.",
         "grid" = "No, that's incorrect.",
         "graphics" = "No, that's incorrect.",
         "grDevices" = "Yes, that's right!",
         correct = 4))
```

Remember that there are two primary graphic models in R: the base and grid graphics. Which one is ggplot2 using?

```{r, echo = FALSE, results = "asis"}
cat(mc_opts("base" = "No, that's incorrect.",
         "grid" = "Yes that's right! Well done!",
         correct = 2))

For the following questions we are going to use `BudgetFood` data from the `Ecdat` package which contains the budget share of food for Spanish households. You can load the dataset and see the structure of the data below.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(Ecdat)
str(BudgetFood)
```
The meaning of the variables are described below:

* `wfood`: percentage of total expenditure which the household has spent on food
* `totexp`: total expenditure of the household
* `age`: age of reference person in the household
* `size`: size of the household
* `town`: size of the town where the household is placed categorized into 5 groups: 1 for small towns, 5 for big ones
* `sex`: sex of reference person (man,woman)

Try to recreate the scatter plot below. Is there anything that unusual that you notice about the plot?
